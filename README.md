This is a Firefox addon that surfaces the participation information that's tucked away in contribute.json files
on various websites. It does this by:
- Adding an icon to the toolbar. 
- detecting whether or not a site has a contribute.json file in its root dir, 
  e.g http://mozilla.org/contribute.json 
- lighting up the icon if it does and 
- presenting the user with the suitably-styled and htmlified contents of that contribute.json file when clicked.

contribute.json reference: http://contribute.paas.allizom.org/
